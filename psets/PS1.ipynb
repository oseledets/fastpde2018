    "The Barnes-Hut (BH) idea is quite simple. First, we separate our particles in a quad-tree structure of particle groups. If the group on some tree level is sufficiently far away from a certain particle, we can approximate its potential by using its center of mass. If it is not, we compute its influence recursively by using lower tree levels. The accuracy of the Barnes-Hut algorithm depends on the choise of parameter $\\theta = s / d$, where $s$ is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and $d$ is the distance between the body and the node's center-of-mass.\n",
